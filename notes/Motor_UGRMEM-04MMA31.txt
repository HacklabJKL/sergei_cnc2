Speed testing:

10V:  600 RPM, 0.4 A
20V: 1340 RPM, 0.5 A
30V: 2110 RPM, 0.6 A
40V: 2890 RPM, 0.7 A
50V: 3660 RPM, 0.8 A

Kv constant 70 RPM/V
Kt constant 0.14 Nm/A

1 cm rise, 1:1 ratio:
=> 0.04 mm per pulse, 0.01 mm per encoder step
=> max speed 60 cm/sec
=> force with 5A drive is 440 N

Could use different ratio gearing, 1:2 or 1:4.

Mating connector: Molex 0003091032

DC resistance 5 ohms
Inductance 0.5 mH
